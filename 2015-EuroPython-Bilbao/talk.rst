asyncio launch
==============

* Python 3.4: March 2014
* Almost naked: very few libraries

Move to Github
==============

* code.google.com is closing
* Move from code.google.com to Github
* Use Git instead of Mercurial: Git is more popular
* Github is widely used, pull requests are simpler

Discussion
==========

* python-tulip mailing list (Google Group)
* #asyncio IRC channel on the Freenode network
* Python bug tracker (bugs.python.org)

aiohttp
=======

* aiohttp: http client and server infrastructure for asyncio
* aiohttp is battle tested

Clients
=======

 * Asterisk: panoramisk, a library based on pythonâ€™s asyncio to play with asterisk's manager
 * !ElasticSearch: aioes, client library
 * IRC: irc3, plugable irc client library based on python's asyncio
 * IRC: bottom, asyncio-based rfc2812-compliant IRC Client
 * XMPP (Jabber): slixmpp, SleekXMPP (XMPP Library) fork using asyncio, for poezio

Databases
=========

SQL drivers:

 * MySQL: aiomysql, MySQL driver
 * PostgreSQL: aiopg, PostgreSQL client library built on top of psycopg2

NoSQL and key-value store drivers:

 * CouchDB: aiocouchdb, CouchDB client
 * memcached: aiomemcache, minimal memcached client
 * MongoDB: asyncio-mongo, MongoDB driver (ported from Twisted)
 * redis: asyncio-redis, Redis client
 * redis: aioredis, Yet another Redis client

ORM:

 * peewee: peewee-async, library providing asynchronous interface powered by asyncio for peewee ORM.

Web frameworks
==============

 * aiopyramid: Tools for running pyramid using asyncio.
 * aiowsgi: minimalist wsgi server using asyncio
 * API hour: Write efficient network daemons (HTTP, SSH, ...) with ease.
 * AutobahnPython: !WebSocket and WAMP framework
 * interest: event-driven web framework on top of aiohttp/asyncio.
 * muffin: A web framework based on Asyncio stack (early alpha)
 * nacho: web framework
 * Pulsar: Event driven concurrent framework for python. With pulsar you can write asynchronous servers performing one or several activities in different threads and/or processes.
 * rainfall: another web framework
 * Vase: web framework
 * websockets: Websockets library
 * WebSocket-for-Python: another websocket library

 Others: ...

Integration with other application libraries
============================================

 * aioamqp: AMQP implementation using asyncio
 * gunicorn: gunicorn has gaiohttp worker built on top of aiohttp library

Run asyncio on top of
=====================

 * eventlet: aiogreen, asyncio API implemented on top of eventlet
 * gevent: aiogevent, asyncio API implemented on top of gevent

Adapters for other event loops
==============================

Some people have already written adapters for integrating asyncio with other
async I/O frameworks.

 * eventlet: greenio, Greenlets support for asyncio (PEP 3156)
 * gevent: tulipcore, run gevent code on top of asyncio, alternative gevent core loop
 * GLib: gbulb, event loop based on GLib
 * libuv: aiouv, an event loop implementation for asyncio based on pyuv
 * Qt: Quamash, implementation of the PEP 3156 Event-Loop with Qt.
 * Tornado has experimental asyncio support built right into it.
 * ZeroMQ: aiozmq, ZeroMQ integration with asyncio
 * ZeroMQ: Zantedeschia, experimental alternative integration between asyncio and ZeroMQ sockets.

Misc
====

 * aiocron: Crontabs for asyncio
 * aiomas: A library for multi-agent systems and RPC based on asyncio
 * aiotest: test suite to validate an implementation of the asyncio API
 * aioprocessing: A Python 3.3+ library that integrates the multiprocessing module with asyncio
 * blender-asyncio: Asyncio Bridge for Blender Python API
 * ipython-yf:  An ipython extension to make it asyncio compatible
 * aiogearman: asyncio gearman support. Gearman provides a generic application framework to farm out work to other machines or processes that are better suited to do the work.
 * Serial port using the serial module, see using serial port in python3 asyncio at Stackoverflow, serial.Serial can be registered with loop.add_reader().

Libraries
=========

 * aiofiles: File support for asyncio
 * aiodns: Async DNS resolver
 * aiorwlock: Read write lock for asyncio.
 * aioutils: Python3 Asyncio Utils, Group (like gevent.pool.Group), Pool (like event.poo.Pool), Bag and OrderedBag.
 * tasklocals: Task-local variables

API-Hour benchmark
=================

* Django, Flask, API-Hour
* Round 5: 50 simultaneous connections with wrk
* between 3000 and 3600 requests/second for API-Hour (asyncio)
* between 600 and 628 requests/second for Django and Flask
* All benchmarks at http://blog.gmludo.eu/

API-Hour benchmark
=================

* Simple JSON document
* API-Hour: around 395,847 requests/second
* Django, Flask: between 70,598 and 79,598 requests/second
* API-Hour handles around 5x more requests per second

API-Hour benchmark
=================

* All benchmarks at http://blog.gmludo.eu/

Trollius
========

* Trollius is the Python 2 port of asyncio
* Work on Python 2.6 - 3.6
* Trollius 2.0

How can you help?
=================

* Need tutorials and more documentation on asyncio!
* https://docs.python.org/dev/library/asyncio.html is more a boring reference
  API doc
* Port more stdlib modules to asyncio: ftplib, smtplib, telnetlib,
  xmlrpclib, etc.
* Interoperability with Twisted

Questions
=========

* asyncio.org
