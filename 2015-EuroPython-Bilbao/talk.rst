Durata: 30 minuti (inc. Q&A)

asyncio launch
==============

* Python 3.4: March 2014
* Almost naked: very few libraries

asyncio moved to Github
=======================

* code.google.com is closing
* Move from code.google.com to Github
* Use Git instead of Mercurial: Git is more popular
* Github is widely used, pull requests are simpler
* At least 26 contributors to asyncio

Discussion
==========

* python-tulip mailing list (Google Group)
* #asyncio IRC channel on the Freenode network
* Python bug tracker (bugs.python.org)

aiohttp
=======

* Most famous and successful project

* (HTTPS support)
* Server WebSockets and Client WebSockets out-of-the-box
* Web-server has Middlewares and pluggable routing
* https://aiohttp.rtfd.org

* aiohttp: http client and server infrastructure for asyncio
* aiohttp is battle tested

Client::

    @asyncio.coroutine
    def fetch_page(url):
        response = yield from aiohttp.request('GET', url)
        assert response.status == 200
        return (yield from response.read())

SQL drivers
===========

 * MySQL: aiomysql
 * PostgreSQL: aiopg (based on psycopg2)

::

    dsn = 'dbname=aiopg user=aiopg password=passwd host=127.0.0.1'

    @asyncio.coroutine
    def go():
        pool = yield from aiopg.create_pool(dsn)
        with (yield from pool.cursor()) as cur:
            yield from cur.execute("SELECT 1")
            ret = yield from cur.fetchone()
            assert ret == (1,)

Adapters for other event loops
==============================

Some people have already written adapters for integrating asyncio with other
async I/O frameworks.

=====

* http://asyncio.org/: Libraries, Docs, Talks, Tutorials, Blogs
* ThirdParty wiki page
* https://github.com/python/asyncio/wiki/ThirdParty

How can you help?
=================

* Need tutorials and more documentation on asyncio!
* https://docs.python.org/dev/library/asyncio.html is more a boring reference
  API doc
* Port more stdlib modules to asyncio: ftplib, poplib, imaplib, nntplib,
  smtplib, smtpd, telnetlib, xmlrpc, etc.
* Interoperability with Twisted
