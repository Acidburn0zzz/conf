Prelude
    “You can’t solve people problems with software.” – Baldur Bjarnason (September 2015)
    “Don’t solve problems with software that should be solved with talking.” – Tanya Reilly (Feb. 2018)
    Python is all about code
    LIES
    Python is all about people

Burnout ---
   February
   No commit between Feb 1-May 15 (i just fixed my regression in march)
   Last commit before: Jan 30
   First commit after: Mar 6
   I stopped *everything* related to Python during 3 months
   Realize my engagment into Python
   Mailing listS, bugs, PRs, mentoring
   working on Python 13h per day, 5 days per 7
   Burnout is a complex thing, it wasn't
      only related to Python, but Python
      was a big part of it.

Open Source

   Why nobody review my pull request?

   Pull requests can be like someone trying to give you a puppy you didn’t ask
      for; they mean well, but they can forget a puppy is a decade-or-more
      commitment and you just don’t like the puppy. – Brett Cannon

   XXX Maintaining an open-source project is like being a Flight Attendant for an
      airline where all tickets are free and the majority of customer surveys
      offer suggestions on how to fly the airplane. – Kelsey Hightower

Problem --
   I don't scale horizontally
   Sorry, I cannot work more than 13h per day
   Quantiy of work is increasing
   While number of new core dev is decreasing: XXX stats

Diversity -
   Talk with women
   Some developers are misogynist

    “When women speak out about diversity and the community, they get penalized
       and branded as non-technical. Some women chose not to speak out because
       of this. We will not be silenced.” – Mariatta Wijaya (April 2018)

   Imposter syndrome
   Unconscious Bias
   "there is no diversity issue"

Social Justice Warior -+
   Don't shoot the messenger
   master/slave shitstorm
   <vidéo d'un hippopotame qui fait caca?>
   Change associated to my real full name and my employer

   "Reminder that even though you are a beta programmer that sits at his
      computer all day, you should still workout and eat well to avoid
      lowering your testosterone to unsafe levels."
   "Fuck you Victor Stinner. You're the enemy of /g/ now. Eat shit. I'll
      probably make a video about this gay shit."
   "I would like him dead."

   I am only a "white dude", now imagine an homosexual or transexual

   "it slowly started off by homosexuality becoming acceptable, now its
      starting to justify pedophilia, and eventually will lead to accepting
      beastiality and necrophilia in the future. America, europe, australia and
      the whole world is doomed. [C]ultural marxism is the best weapon the jew has
      ever used so far, after realizing communism will not win."

   "Attention, on va bientôt interdire les touches noires des pianos..."

Mentoring +
   Positive Action
   Guido mentored Mariatta
   I mentored XXX people: Pablo became a core dev
   Give a Man a Fish, and You Feed Him for a Day. Teach a Man To Fish, and You
      Feed Him for a Lifetime
   Long term goal: stop writing code, only review and mentor
   Mentoring is an efficient way to train but also to build a trust relationship

Success ++
   Why Diversity?
   INADA Naoki from Japan is very active on Unicode support
      BDFL-Delegate on Nick Coghlan's PEP 538 (C locale coercion)
         and my PEP 540 (UTF-8 Mode), both approved in Python 3.7
      US developers care less about Unicode: ASCII is fine...
   Women core dev: 0 in 2016, 2 in 2017, 2018: at least 4
   Guido mentored Mariatta, become our first woman core developer
   I mentored XXX people: Pablo became a core dev
   XXX: no code of conduct
   XXX: code of conduct on mailing lists, website, bug tracker
   2018: process to report CoC violations at Pycon US 2018, professional service (Otter)
   PyLadies: Women Who Love Coding in Python
   DjangoGirls: We inspire women to fall in love with programming.
   Trans*Code: hack event series focused solely on drawing attention to
      transgender issues and opportunities
